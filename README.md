mygithubpage
============

This is an example of a "Project page site owned by a user account" as described on Github's [About Custom Domains page](https://help.github.com/articles/about-custom-domains-for-github-pages-sites/#how-github-pages-sites-use-custom-domains).

The source for what is served is found in the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/jedfonner/mygithubpage/tree/gh-pages) of this repo.

The source code in that branch is [rendered using Jeykll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) and is then served at http://jedfonner.com/mygithubpage.

Note: if there was not already an [apex record](https://help.github.com/articles/about-custom-domains-for-github-pages-sites/#apex-domains) in place for jedfonner.github.com, then this repo would be served at http://jedfonner.github.io/mygithubpage.
